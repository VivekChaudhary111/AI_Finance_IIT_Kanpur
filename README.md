## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to the **Techkriti'25 x NFRA Hackathon**, where AI meets finance! This hackathon challenges participants to develop an AI-powered application that simplifies and explains complex financial statements for amateur users. Using **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI**, teams will create an interactive tool to make financial data accessible and insightful.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Financial statements are crucial for assessing a company’s health, but they are often filled with jargon and complex calculations. Many individuals lack the expertise to interpret these documents, making informed financial decision-making difficult. This hackathon aims to bridge that knowledge gap by leveraging AI to:
- 📊 Extract key financial and non-financial data.
- 🧠 Provide clear, easy-to-understand insights.
- 🔍 Compare company narratives from financial statements with their public communications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Data Extraction**: Utilize **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract relevant data from financial statements.
- **Simplification & Explanation**: Implement LLMs to interpret and narrate financial trends in simple language, creating a readable "story" of a company’s financial trajectory.
- **Interactive Features**: Develop an intuitive interface that enables users to query specific financial aspects and receive easy-to-understand responses.
- **Visual Aids**: Integrate **graphs, charts, and dashboards** to enhance comprehension.
- **Educational Module**: Include learning resources to improve financial literacy.

## 🚀 Expected Outcomes
- ✅ A **functional prototype** demonstrating AI-powered financial analysis.
- 📝 **User-friendly insights** presented via text, speech, and visual graphics.
- 📉 **Comparison of actual financial health vs. public perception**, offering meaningful recommendations.

## 🏆 Judging Criteria
The hackathon entries will be judged based on:
- **🚀 Innovation & Creativity (25%)**: Novel approaches to simplifying financial data.
- **🛠️ Technical Execution (30%)**: The ability to detect and interpret financial stories accurately.
- **🎨 User Experience (35%)**: Simplicity, clarity, and ease of use.
- **📊 Quality of Insights (10%)**: The depth of educational value provided.

## 📌 Example Scenario
A bank shows rapid growth, low bad loans, and high profits. However, financial statements reveal:
- ⚠️ **Aggressive lending practices**
- ❗ **Hidden risks in non-performing assets (NPAs)**
- 🔍 **Underreporting of financial stress**

The AI-powered tool will analyze such discrepancies, narrate them in simple terms, and warn users about potential financial risks.

1. **Round 1**: AI model development (overnight coding sprint).
2. **Round 2**: 15-minute presentation per team.
